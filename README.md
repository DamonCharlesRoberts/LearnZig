# My exploration of Zig

I have been feeling a stronger pull towards more lower-level languages. There are lots of reasons for it, but that is where I currently am at. 
The language that has caught my attention the most is Zig. I have played around with `C` and `C++`, but I also want to give a real hard look at a more modern one. Rust vs. Zig.
I thought I'd go with Zig first.

So, here's my random scripts playing around with Zig and trying to build some muscle memory and try different features of the syntax. May try out Ziglings next.
